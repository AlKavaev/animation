Description: This package contains various functions for animations in
  statistics, covering many areas such as probability theory,
  mathematical statistics, multivariate statistics, nonparametric
  statistics, sampling survey, linear models, time series,
  computational statistics, data mining and machine learning. These
  functions might be of help in teaching statistics and data
  analysis. Also provided in this package are several approaches to
  save animations to various formats, e.g. Flash, GIF, HTML pages, PDF
  and videos (saveSWF(), saveGIF(), saveHTML(), saveLatex(), and
  saveVideo() respectively). PDF animations can be inserted into
  Sweave easily.
SystemRequirements: ImageMagick (http://imagemagick.org) or GraphicsMagick (http://www.graphicsmagick.org) or LyX (http://www.lyx.org) for saveGIF(); (PDF)LaTeX for saveLatex(); SWF Tools (http://swftools.org) for saveSWF(); FFmpeg (http://ffmpeg.org) for saveVideo()
